/// A simplistic representation of an upstream data source. keepAlive is set to true because:
/// - When upstream data changes, all keepalive links are removed from the downstream provider
/// - If the downstream does not have any current listeners it will not be rebuilt
/// - If the downstream is not rebuilt, the upstream will have no listeners
/// - Without keepAlive, if the upstream has no listeners, it will be disposed of and the state lost
///
/// When new listeners attach to a *proper* upstream data source, the data source would be able
/// to fetch the state again from scratch or load it from a database cache like Firestore's internal
/// cache. To avoid implementing such behaviour in these tests we use keepAlive to prevent the state
/// being lost when there are no listeners. In our application code, keeping alive too many data
/// sources could lead to memory leaks, so it is important to use this feature judiciously.
///
/// Each test is still able to access an independent value of this provider, thanks to the use of a
/// [ProviderContainer] in each test which scopes all providers to the test.
///
